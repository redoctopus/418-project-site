## 15-428 Project: Parallelized Real-Time CPU Raytracing
Jocelyn Huang (jocelynh)


### Summary

I am going to modify and optimize an existing CPU-based raytracer to run in real-time and in parallel. To do so, I will be exploiting SIMD instructions and implementing and researching raytracing-specific optimizations to reduce memory and CPU usage.


### Background

Raytracing is a common rendering technique that involves computing the paths taken by rays that would hit a "camera lens" in the place of the screen. Since the individual path of any given ray emanating from a pixel of the image is independent of the paths of any other ray, this problem is embarassingly parallel. Therefore, the challenge lies in the computation-heavy nature of the problem, specifically, in speeding a raytracer up to be able to render in real-time.

To this end, my initial goal is of course to parallelize the raytracing operations using multithreading. However, the main goal of this project is to speed up the CPU implementation enough for the raytracer to run in real-time. We first recognize that the operations in tracing any given ray do not change much across individual rays. So in order to attain the needed speedup for real-time rendering, I will first be exploiting instruction-level parallelism in the form of SIMD instructions to increase the rate at which work can be done.

In addition, I will be tweaking the code in order to make good use of the cache, which may be especially important when running multiple elements in a SIMD vector at a time, and see if improvements can be made by constraining the working set at any given time. I also plan to try implementing an "adaptive subsampling" technique (somewhat explained [https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20100923081853/http://www.exceed.hu/h7/subsample.htm](here)) in order to reduce the total number of rays that need to be traced, as part of the computational bound on this problem is the large number of rays in a single image.


### The Challenge

The main challenge here is not in maximizing the amount of parallelism in the program, but in speeding up and optimizing the operations needed for rendering a single frame such that the raytracer can produce real-time results (around 30fps). The work itself is very parallelizable, as the workload itself consists of a great many independent operations, but the computation for each ray also needs to access the metadata for the triangles it intersects, and the fact still stands that there are many individual rays that need to be computed for the entire image. Also note that a given CPU cannot run all that many threads at once (and certainly now as many threads in parallel as a GPU could), so it will be an interesting experience to try to see how well I can do with CPU parallelism.


### Resources

As suggested by Professor Kayvon, I will not be writing a renderer from scratch; instead, I will be modifying an existing CPU-based raytracer to run in parallel and then optimizing it. I have yet to find a good starting codebase, and would appreciate help in doing so. I would also appreciate having access to a machine that has a nicer CPU than the 2011 Macbook Air that I currently use, although that would certainly add to the challenge.
